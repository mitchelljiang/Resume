# Resume (LaTeX)

This repository contains my professional resume, built using LaTeX. It is designed to showcase my experience, education, and skills in a clean and professional format. You can compile the LaTeX source file to generate a PDF version of the resume or you can directly download the pdf located in the same folder.

To compile the resume, you will need a LaTeX distribution. Here are some options for setting up your environment:
- **TeX Live** (Linux/Windows/macOS)
- **MiKTeX** (Windows)
- **MacTeX** (macOS)
  
You can also directly upload the .tex file on Overleaf and it will compile the document automatically.
